# fake_news_classifier

In this project, a fake news classifier will be created using four different models - Random Forest, KNN, Linear SVM, and Logistic Regression. There will be 3 datasets used. The first will be split into training and testing sets and will be used to train each model. The other two datasets will be used to evaluate how well the trained models work on different datasets. The business problem is to determine whether or not we can create a classification model that can accurately predict whether a news article is real or fake.
